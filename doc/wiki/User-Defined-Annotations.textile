It is possible to create new annotations, behaviors for those annotations, and then register them with a @FramedGraph@. In order to make use of this feature, two Java classes are required of the developer.

# @Annotation@: An annotation object.
# @AnnotationHandler@: A class defining the behavior to evaluate when the respective @Annotation@ is used.

The @AnnotationHandler@ interface is provided below.

```java
public interface AnnotationHandler<T extends Annotation> {
    public Class<T> getAnnotationType();
    public Object processVertex(T annotation, Method method, Object[] arguments, FramesManager manager, Vertex vertex);
    public Object processEdge(T annotation, Method method, Object[] arguments, FramesManager manager, Edge edge, Direction direction);
}
```

Any implementation of an @AnnotationHandler@ must implement the respective methods where @getAnnotationType()@ returns the class of the respective @Annotation@ it represents. The two methods @processVertex()@ and @processEdge()@ have arguments that provide information to allow the developer to determine the requisite logic to execute. For example, here are some aspects to reason on:

* Determine if the method is a _get_, _set_, or _remove_ by @method.getName().startsWith("get")@
* Make use of @ClassUtilities@ for standard, static reasoning methods.
* Analyze the types of method's provided arguments.
* Analyze the type of the methods return object.

All the @Annotation@ objects provided by Frames make use of handlers. Please feel free to inspect the source code to get ideas for how to implement your own handlers. Finally, once an @Annotation@ and @AnnotationHandler@ have been created, they can be registered with a @FramedGraph@. 

```java
FramedGraph<TinkerGraph> graph = new FramedGraph<TinkerGraph>(new TinkerGraph("/tmp/tg"));
graph.registerAnnotation(new MyAnnotation());
```
