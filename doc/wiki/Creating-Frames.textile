When you develop a Frames-annotation Java interface, you provide it "life" by binding it to the underlying "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com graph. To make this binding, the @FramesManager@ is used. In @FramesManager@ there a collection of helpful methods which are articulate using the toy graph diagrammed below and the example Java code.

```java
Graph graph = ... // get a reference to the graph
FramesManager manager = new FramesManager(graph); // create a manager for the graph

Person marko = manager.frame(graph.getVertex(1), Person.class);
Person peter = manager.frameVertex(6, Person.class);
Iterable<Project> javaProjects = manager.frameVertices(Index.VERTICES, "lang", "java", Project.class);

Knows markoKnowsVadas = manager.frame(graph.getEdge(7), Direction.STANDARD, Knows.class);
Knows markoKnowsJosh = manager.frameEdge(8, Direction.STANDARD, Knows.class);
Iterable<CreatedBy> createdByRelations = manager.frameEdges(Index.EDGES, AutomaticIndex.LABEL, "created", Direction.INVERSE, CreatedBy.class);
