Frames is a bare-bones library. Luckily, its part of a larger ecosystem of graph technologies. When using Frames, you will find yourself making use of framed domain objects and "Blueprints":http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com.

h2. Managing Transactions

Frames has no notion of transaction management. To manage transactions, use Blueprints.

```java
Graph graph = ... // get reference to graph
graph.startTransaction();
// do Frames related mutations to the graph
graph.stopTransaction(Conclusion.SUCCESS);
```
